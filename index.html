        <p>This is my story on how I came to have many hobbies and interests. My goal in life is to learn as much as I can while having fun. I met so many types of people just by being open minded, trying new things.
            One of my dreams is also to study Abroad or even to land a job overseas. Traveling has been on my mind lately and I hope to make this website into a Blog, little by little, even 
            put my experiences on how my hobbies got me to where I am today. Below are examples of some of the art types I mainly work with and also a KPop group that has insired me.
     <ul>
           <li>Painting with Acrylic:
            Acrylic painting is a versatile medium known for its fast drying time and vibrant colors. It allows artists to create both bold textures and subtle blends.

            Techniques: Layering, blending, dry brushing, etc.
            Subjects: Landscapes, portraits, abstracts, etc.
            Materials: Types of acrylic paints, brushes, canvases, and other tools.
            Do you have a specific aspect of acrylic painting you'd like to explore?

            <Li>Eye for Photography and Art:
            Having an eye for photography and art involves understanding composition, lighting, color theory, and emotional impact. It's about capturing moments or creating visual narratives that resonate with viewers. We could discuss:

            Composition: Rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, etc.
            Lighting: Natural vs. artificial light, using light to create mood.
            Subjects: Portraits, landscapes, still life, etc.
            Editing: Techniques and software for enhancing photos.
            Would you like to share any specific photographs or artworks you've created?
            </Li>
            

            <li>Stray Kids: How They Came to Be:
            Stray Kids is a South Korean boy group known for their energetic performances and meaningful lyrics. They were formed through a reality show called "Stray Kids" by JYP Entertainment. The show aimed to find members who could showcase their talents in rapping, singing, and dancing while also demonstrating their potential as songwriters and producers.

            Key points about Stray Kids:

            Formation: They were initially intended to have a different lineup but eventually settled on the current eight members.
            Debut: They officially debuted in March 2018 with the mini-album "I Am NOT" and the title track "District 9."
            Music Style: Known for their mix of hip-hop, EDM, and rock influences, they often tackle themes of youth, identity, and societal issues in their music.
            Rise to Fame: They quickly gained popularity internationally for their powerful performances and unique music style.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Karen Hernadnez, a 29 year-old passionate individual who loves to draw, paint, do photography, and make baskets. I'm a huge fan of Kpop, 
            especially Stray Kids. I'm multilingual and currently learning my fourth language. I have a keen interest in learning new things and spend my free time playing video games,
            reading, playing soccer, or sand volleyball. I also enjoy attending conventions and cosplaying. It all started at the age of 5, I was already drawing complex cartoon characters,
            scribbling on paper while being taught my second language, English. Once I made it to middle school I was sought out by the art instructor, he wanted me in his class to teach me 
            structor and better perspective. Long story short I kept drawing and painting for friends and family. Once I made it to College, I didn't know what I wanted to do, my goals were not 
            clear, that is until I met my photography Professor and that is where I fell in love with photograohy.
             He and my classmates all said I had the eyes for this career so I decided to persue it not giving it much thought. I then went to a University where the Dean himself chose me to be 
             in class, again to make sure I learn more structure and really challenge me to excell as I was pursuing this I also continued my art carrer and went into Anatomy and Design. After all that was done
             I ended up getting a few individuals into becoming models, then I wanted to try to be in front of the camera so I went to acting and modeling school and even there I loved it!
