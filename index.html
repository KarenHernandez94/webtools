        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>This is my story on how I came to have many hobbies and interests. My goal in life is to learn as much as I can while having fun. I met so many types of people just by being open minded, trying new things.
            One of my dreams is also to study Abroad or even to land a job overseas. Traveling has been on my lind lately and I hope to make this website into a Blog, little by little, even 
            put my experiences on how my hobbies got me to where I am today.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Karen Hernadnez, a 29 year-old passionate individual who loves to draw, paint, do photography, and make baskets. I'm a huge fan of Kpop, 
            especially Stray Kids. I'm multilingual and currently learning my fourth language. I have a keen interest in learning new things and spend my free time playing video games,
            reading, playing soccer or sand volleyball. I also enjoy attending conventions and cosplaying. It all started at the age of 5, I was already drawing complex cartoon characters,
            scribbling on paper while being taught my second language, English. Once I made it to middle school I was sought out by the art instructor, he wanted me in his class to teach me 
            structor and better perspective. Long story short I kept drawing and painting for friends and family. Once I made it to College, I didn't know what I wanted to do, my goals were not 
            clear, that is until I met my photography Professor and that is where I fell in love with photograohy.
             He and my classmates all said I had the eyes for this career so I decided to persue it not giving it much thought. I then went to a University where the Dean himself chose me to be 
             in class, again to make sure I learn more structure and really challenge me to excell as I was pursuing this I also continued my art carrer and went into Anatomy and Design. After all that was done
             I ended up getting a few individuals into becoming models, then I wanted to try to be in front of the camera so I went to acting and modeling school and even there I loved it!

                        Starting painting can be an exciting journey! Here are some steps to help you begin:
                        
                        Gather Your Materials:
                        
                        Decide what type of painting you want to start with (e.g., watercolor, acrylics, oils).
                        Purchase basic supplies such as paints, brushes, canvases or paper, palette, and water containers if needed.
                        Set Up Your Workspace:
                        
                        Find a comfortable and well-lit space where you can work without distractions.
                        Protect your work surface with newspaper or a drop cloth.
                        Choose Your Subject:
                        
                        As a beginner, you might start with simple subjects such as still life (e.g., fruit, flowers), landscapes, or abstract shapes.
                        Learn Some Basics:
                        
                        Familiarize yourself with basic techniques like blending colors, brush strokes, and mixing paints.
                        Watch tutorials online or read introductory books about your chosen painting medium.
                        Start with Simple Exercises:
                        
                        Begin with basic exercises to practice techniques, such as color mixing, shading, and creating different textures.
                        Experiment with different brushes and tools to see what works best for you.
                        Paint Regularly:
                        
                        Like any skill, painting improves with practice. Try to paint regularly to build your skills and confidence.
                        Don't worry about making mistakes; they are part of the learning process.
                        Seek Inspiration:
                        
                        Look at other artists' work for inspiration and ideas. Visit galleries, browse online art communities, or follow artists on social media.
                        Join a Class or Community:
                        
                        Consider taking a beginner's painting class or workshop in your local area or online.
                        Join online forums or local art groups to connect with other painters and share experiences.
                        Experiment and Have Fun:
                        
                        Allow yourself to experiment with different styles and techniques to find what you enjoy most.
                        Remember that painting is a creative outlet, so enjoy the process and express yourself freely.
                        Keep Learning:
                        
                        Continuously seek to improve your skills by learning new techniques, exploring different subjects, and challenging yourself creatively.

                        <dt id="2">How to Start Photography?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Starting photography can be both rewarding and creatively fulfilling. Here's a guide to help you begin:
                        
                        Get a Camera:
                        
                        Decide whether you want to use a digital camera or a smartphone. Both can be excellent starting points.
                        If using a digital camera, consider entry-level DSLRs or mirrorless cameras, or even compact digital cameras with manual controls.
                        Learn the Basics of Exposure:
                        
                        Understand the fundamentals of exposure, which include aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
                        Experiment with these settings to see how they affect your photos. There are many tutorials and online resources available to help you grasp these concepts.
                        Master Composition:
                        
                        Composition is key to creating visually appealing photographs. Learn about concepts like rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, and perspective.
                        Practice composing your shots deliberately, paying attention to what elements you include in the frame and their arrangement.
                        Understand Lighting:
                        
                        Lighting is crucial in photography. Learn how natural and artificial light affect your subjects.
                        Experiment with different lighting conditions (e.g., soft light, harsh light, golden hour) to see how they impact your photos.
                        Explore Different Genres:
                        
                        Photography encompasses various genres such as landscape, portrait, street, macro, and more.
                        Try out different genres to discover what interests you the most and where your strengths lie.
                        Edit Your Photos:
                        
                        Post-processing can enhance your images. Learn basic editing techniques using software like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, or mobile apps.
                        Start with simple adjustments like exposure, contrast, and white balance, then progress to more advanced techniques as you become comfortable.
                        Study Other Photographers' Work:
                        
                        Look at photographs from established photographers for inspiration and to learn from their techniques.
                        Analyze what makes their photos compelling and try to incorporate similar elements into your own work.
                        Practice Regularly:
                        
                        The more you practice, the better you'll become. Take your camera with you everywhere and photograph subjects that interest you.
                        Don't be afraid to experiment and take lots of shots. Digital photography allows for unlimited practice without the cost of film.
                        Join Photography Communities:
                        
                        Connect with other photographers through online forums, social media groups, or local photography clubs.
                        Participate in photo challenges, share your work for feedback, and learn from others' experiences.
                        Have Patience and Persistence:
                        
                        Photography is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing.
                        Celebrate your progress and learn from your mistakes along the way.
                        Starting photography is about exploring your creativity and capturing moments in a unique way. Enjoy the process of learning and discovering your photographic style!</dd>
