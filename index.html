        <p>This is my story on how I came to have many hobbies and interests. My goal in life is to learn as much as I can while having fun. I met so many types of people just by being open minded, trying new things.
            One of my dreams is also to study Abroad or even to land a job overseas. Traveling has been on my lind lately and I hope to make this website into a Blog, little by little, even 
            put my experiences on how my hobbies got me to where I am today.

                        Starting painting can be an exciting journey! Here are some steps to help you begin:
                        
                        Gather Your Materials:
                        
                        Decide what type of painting you want to start with (e.g., watercolor, acrylics, oils).
                        Purchase basic supplies such as paints, brushes, canvases or paper, palette, and water containers if needed.
                        Set Up Your Workspace:
                        
                        Familiarize yourself with basic techniques like blending colors, brush strokes, and mixing paints.
                        Watch tutorials online or read introductory books about your chosen painting medium.
                        Start with Simple Exercises:
                        
                        Begin with basic exercises to practice techniques, such as color mixing, shading, and creating different textures.
                        Experiment with different brushes and tools to see what works best for you.
                        Paint Regularly:
                        
                        Like any skill, painting improves with practice. Try to paint regularly to build your skills and confidence.
                        Don't worry about making mistakes; they are part of the learning process.
                        Seek Inspiration:

                        Starting photography can be both rewarding and creatively fulfilling. Here's a guide to help you begin:
                        
                        Get a Camera:
                        
                        Decide whether you want to use a digital camera or a smartphone. Both can be excellent starting points.
                        If using a digital camera, consider entry-level DSLRs or mirrorless cameras, or even compact digital cameras with manual controls.
                        Learn the Basics of Exposure:
                        
                        Understand the fundamentals of exposure, which include aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
                        Experiment with these settings to see how they affect your photos. There are many tutorials and online resources available to help you grasp these concepts.
