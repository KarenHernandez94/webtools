        <p> This is my story on how I came to have many hobbies and interests. My goal in life is to learn as much as I can while having fun. I met so many types of people just by being open minded, trying new things.
            One of my dreams is also to study Abroad or even to land a job overseas. Traveling has been on my lind lately and I hope to make this website into a Blog, little by little, even 
            put my experiences on how my hobbies got me to where I am today.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Karen Hernadnez, a 29 year-old passionate individual who loves to draw, paint, do photography, and make baskets. I'm a huge fan of Kpop, 
            especially Stray Kids. I'm multilingual and currently learning my fourth language. I have a keen interest in learning new things and spend my free time playing video games,
            reading, playing soccer, or sand volleyball. I also enjoy attending conventions and cosplaying.
