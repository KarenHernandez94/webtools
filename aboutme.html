                Hello! I'm Karen Hernadnez, a 29 year-old passionate individual who loves to draw, paint, do photography, and make baskets. I'm a huge fan of Kpop, 
                especially Stray Kids. I'm multilingual and currently learning my fourth language. I have a keen interest in learning new things and spend my free time playing video games,
                reading, playing soccer or sand volleyball. I also enjoy attending conventions and cosplaying. It all started at the age of 5, I was already drawing complex cartoon characters,
                scribbling on paper while being taught my second language, English. Once I made it to middle school I was sought out by the art instructor, he wanted me in his class to teach me 
                structor and better perspective. Long story short I kept drawing and painting for friends and family. Once I made it to College, I didn't know what I wanted to do, my goals were not 
                clear, that is until I met my photography Professor and that is where I fell in love with photograohy.
                 He and my classmates all said I had the eyes for this career so I decided to persue it not giving it much thought. I then went to a University where the Dean himself chose me to be 
                 in class, again to make sure I learn more structure and really challenge me to excell as I was pursuing this I also continued my art carrer and went into Anatomy and Design. After all that was done
                 I ended up getting a few individuals into becoming models, then I wanted to try to be in front of the camera so I went to acting and modeling school and even there I loved it!
